### Git stash to hold uncommitted changes for later and then reapply when ready

Check what's to be committed
`$ git status`

Stash your current work (if uncommitted changes exist)
`$ git stash`

(Now you can add any changes, new commits, swich branches, etc.)

Check branch you want to commit stashed stuff to
`$ git status`

Now apply changes to your current work (may need to accept/ignore new changes if copy from stashed isn't same if current work edited since)
`$ git stash pop`

Or, you can reapply changes AND keep them in stash with:
`$ git stash apply`
